Validate IP Address
Validate an IP address (IPv4). An address is valid if and only if it is in the form "X.X.X.X", where each X is a number from 0 to 255.

For example, "12.34.5.6", "0.23.25.0", and "255.255.255.255" are valid IP addresses, while "12.34.56.oops", "1.2.3.4.5", and "123.235.153.425" are invalid IP addresses.

Examples:

ip = '192.168.0.1'
output: true

ip = '0.0.0.0'
output: true

ip = '123.24.59.99'
output: true

ip = '192.168.123.456'
output: false
Constraints:

[time limit] 5000ms
[input] string ip
[output] boolean
