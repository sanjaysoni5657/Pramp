Validate IP Address
How many periods (’.’) must the IP address have?

A good idea is to split the string into chunks delimited by the period character (’.’).

For each chunk delimited by a period, how many possibile strings are there?

Does your code handle addresses like 008.123.34.56 appropriately?
