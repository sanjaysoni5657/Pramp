Array Quadruplet
Any solution of more than O(N^3) is not efficient enough. Please rate your peer accordingly on the problem solving section.
If you peer can’t think of the any solution, encourage them to implement first a brute force solution and then optimize it.
If your peer can’t improve the naive solution, ask them how using sorting can improve the time complexity.
If still no progress, ask your peer to try first to solve the problem for a pair of integers instead of a quadruplet (i.e. find two numbers whose sum is s etc.). Then ask them to generalize that solution to a quadruplet.
