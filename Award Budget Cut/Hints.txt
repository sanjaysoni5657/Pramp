Award Budget Cuts
If you peer is stuck, ask them how they can use sorting in order to arrive to the solution. It’s probably easier to solve if the array is sorted in a descending order. However, this is not a must.
If your peer doesn’t know how to proceed, suggest to them to test out each of the values in the sorted grants array as a potential cap.
A key step in the solution is knowing how to test whether a certain value is indeed the cap. Push your peer to provide a clear explanation on how to do that.
If your peer is in the right direction, they’d be able to find out a lower bound to the cap, based on the given grants values. The next step in the solution then would be to calculate the exact cap given that lower bound.
Note that there can be only one possible value of cap. You peer may not pay attention to the cap definition and use a lower cap that affects more grants. Make sure your peer is solving for the right cap as defined - one that affects the minimum number of grants.
