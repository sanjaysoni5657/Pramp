Bracket Match
Encourage your peer to look at examples in order to understand the rules for matching bracket strings. Make sure your peer understands that matching brackets requires more than an equal number of '(' and ')'.

If your peer is stuck, suggest to consider the prefixes of matching bracket strings, and to check the difference between prefixes of matching bracket strings to the non-matching ones in the example.

If they need a more explicit hint, you may consider pointing out that in every prefix of a matching bracket string, the number of '(' is equal or greater than the number of ')'.

Finally, if your peer needs additional assistance, guide them to iterate through the input string, and use a counter in order to count the difference between the number of '(' and ')' for each prefix:

Every time the counter goes below 0, i.e. the current prefix has more ')' than '(' , then increment the counter by 1, since we must add an additional '(' to the beginning of the text in order to correct the brackets.

At the end of the string, if we find more '(' than ')', we need to add additional ')' to the end of the string, we need to add the number of extra '(' to the counter. This holds since for every extra '(', we have to put an additional ')' to the end of the string, in order to correct the brackets.
