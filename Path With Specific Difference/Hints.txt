Pairs with Specific Difference
If your peer is stuck, ask them to start with the brute force solution and then try to optimize it.
If your peer needs additional help, suggest that using an auxiliary data structure might make the solution more efficient.
If this doesnâ€™t help, ask them if splitting the problem into indexing and then searching could help us come up with an optimal solution.
