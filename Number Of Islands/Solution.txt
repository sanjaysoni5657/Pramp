Island Count
This problem is very similar to counting the number of connected components in an Undirected Graph. However, Graph Theory isn’t necessary to solve this problem or to understand its solution. In an undirected graph, a connected component is a group of vertices in which every vertex is connected to at least one other vertex. In a similar way, an island in the matrix is a group of adjacent (connected) 1s.

To solve this problem, we’ll traverse binaryMatrix and every time we come across a cell of 1 we’ll do the following: Change that cell and all its vertically and horizontally (but not diagonally) adjacent 1s into -1s. We do this “expansion” in order to avoid recounting of islands. Increment islands - which is our counter for number of islands - by 1. Expanding from a cell whose value is 1 to other adjacent 1s in binaryMatrix is similar to running a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or a Depth-First Search (DFS).

In our case, we’ll avoid using a recursion and instead opt for an iterative approach to expand to all adjacent 1s. We do so by using queue that holds the next indices to visit. We keep expanding to other adjacent 1s as long as the queue is not empty. Whenever we encounter a value of -1 in our traversal, we ignore it since it is part on an island we’ve already counted.

Pseudocode:

function getNumberOfIslands(binaryMatrix):
    islands = 0
    rows = binaryMatrix.length # number of rows
    cols = binaryMatrix[0].length # number of columns

    for i from 0 to rows-1:
        for j from 0 to cols-1:
            if (binaryMatrix[i][j] == 1):
                markIsland(binaryMatrix, rows, cols, i, j)
                islands++
                
    return islands


function markIsland(binaryMatrix, rows, cols, i, j):
    q = new Queue()
    q.push([i,j])
    while (!q.isEmpty()):
        item = q.pop()
        x = item[0]
        y = item[1]
        if (binaryMatrix[x][y] == 1):
            binaryMatrix[x][y] = -1
            pushIfValid(q, rows, cols, x-1, y)
            pushIfValid(q, rows, cols, x, y-1)
            pushIfValid(q, rows, cols, x+1, y)
            pushIfValid(q, rows, cols, x, y+1)


function pushIfValid(q, rows, cols, x, y):
    if (x >= 0 AND x < rows AND y >= 0 AND y < cols):
        q.push([x,y])

Time Complexity: let N and M be the numbers of columns and rows in binaryMatrix, respectively. Each cell in binaryMatrix is visited a constant number of times. Once during the iteration and up to 4 times during an island expansion. Therefore, the time complexity is linear in the size of the input, i.e. O(N⋅M).

Space Complexity: since we are allocating a queue in the algorithm, the space complexity is linear O(N⋅M). For instance, consider a matrix that is all 1s.
